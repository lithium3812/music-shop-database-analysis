# Data Analytics with degital music store database
In this project, I worked on data analysis of a database of a fictitious degital music shop like iTunes store. 

## Database
This database is called Chinook and publicly available from [here](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database). I worked with SQLite portable database 'chinook.db'. 
The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. 
This information is contained in eleven tables.
